// Named Color Variables
// --------------------------------------------------
// Named colors makes it easy to reuse colors on various components.
// It's highly recommended to change the default colors
// to match your app's branding. Ionic uses a Sass map of
// colors so you can add, rename and remove colors as needed.
// The "primary" color is the only required color in the map.

$colors: (
        primary:    #488aff,
        secondary:  #32db64,
        danger:     #f53d3d,
        light:      #f4f4f4,
        dark:       #222,
        yellow: #ffcd35,
        logoz: #E9D300,
        plava:#375990
